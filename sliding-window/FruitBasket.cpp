     * Fruits into Baskets (medium)
     * 
     * You are visiting a farm to collect fruits. The farm has a single row of fruit trees. 
     * You will be given two baskets, and your goal is to pick as many fruits as possible to be placed in the given baskets.
     * You will be given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree. 
     * The farm has following restrictions:
     *      Each basket can have only one type of fruit. 
     *      There is no limit to how many fruit a basket can hold.
     *      You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
     *      You will pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
     *      Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.
     * 
     * Example 1:
     *      Input: arr=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C'] 
     *      Output: 3  
     *      Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
     * 
     * Logic/Think through:
     *      Very similar to the "longest substring with K distinct letters" but K = 2
     *      For each tree in the array
     *      if the tree has been picked: do nothing
     *      if the tree has not been picked: add the tree to the set of picked
     *      if the set of picked trees is greater than 2: 
     *          check the number of picked fruits and compare with the running max
     *          remove the front trees
