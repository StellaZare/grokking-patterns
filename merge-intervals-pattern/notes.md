Merge Intervals Pattern
------------------------------------------------------------------

- Efficient technique to deal with overlappingintervals

- Given 2 intervals A and B there will be 6 different ways they can relate
    1. no overlap - A then B
    2. end of A overlaps the start of B
    3. A completely overlaps B
    4. end of B overlaps the start of A
    5. B completely overlaps A
    6. no overlap - B then A
