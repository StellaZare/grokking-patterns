Intoduction to Graphs
------------------------------------------------------------------

- data structure with vertices and edges connecting vertices
- vertices represented as a set and edges represented as a set of tuples

Adjacent vertices: 2 vertices sharing an edge are adjacent
Digraph: directed graph
Degree: the number of edges a vertex has
Path: a sequence of vertices connected by edges
